## Best Pasta for Carbonara

Traditional carbonara is best made with **spaghetti**, but you can also use **rigatoni** or **fettuccine** for a slight variation.

## Ingredients

- 200g spaghetti
- 100g pancetta (or guanciale), diced
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup grated Pecorino Romano (or Parmesan)
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- Salt, to taste
- 1 tbsp olive oil (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Cook the pasta** – Boil spaghetti in salted water until _al dente_. Reserve _1/2 cup pasta water_, then drain.
2. **Prepare the pancetta** – In a pan over medium heat, cook pancetta until crispy. Remove from heat.
3. **Mix the sauce** – In a bowl, whisk eggs, cheese, and black pepper until combined.
4. **Combine** – Add drained pasta to the pan with pancetta, then slowly mix in the egg mixture, tossing quickly to create a creamy sauce. Use reserved pasta water to adjust consistency if needed.
5. **Serve** – Top with extra cheese and black pepper. Serve immediately.

## Tips & Variations

- Use **guanciale** instead of pancetta for authentic flavor.
- Never add cream—carbonara gets its creaminess from eggs and cheese.
- Work quickly when mixing to prevent the eggs from scrambling.
