Chocolate Mousse
Chocolate mousse is the ultimate indulgence—a velvety, airy dessert that combines the richness of chocolate with a light, fluffy texture. Perfect for special occasions or a sweet treat after a meal, this mousse is surprisingly easy to make and always a hit.

Ingredients:
200g (7 oz) dark chocolate (70% cocoa recommended)
3 large eggs, separated
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup heavy cream
A pinch of salt
Whipped cream (optional, for topping)
Chocolate shavings or cocoa powder (optional, for garnish)
Instructions:
Melt the Chocolate: Break the dark chocolate into small pieces and melt it either in a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method) or in the microwave in 30-second intervals. Stir until smooth and fully melted. Let it cool slightly.

Whip the Egg Whites: In a clean bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt using an electric mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add the granulated sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form. Set aside.

Whisk the Egg Yolks: In another bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the vanilla extract until smooth and slightly pale in color.

Combine the Chocolate and Egg Yolks: Slowly add the melted chocolate into the egg yolk mixture, stirring gently to combine.

Fold in the Whipped Cream: In a separate bowl, beat the heavy cream until it forms soft peaks. Carefully fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture until smooth and well incorporated.

Fold in the Egg Whites: Gently fold the whipped egg whites into the chocolate mixture in three batches. Be careful not to deflate the mousse—use a light hand to maintain its airy texture.

Chill and Serve: Spoon the mousse into serving glasses or bowls and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until set. Before serving, top with whipped cream and garnish with chocolate shavings or a dusting of cocoa powder, if desired.

Tiramisu
Tiramisu is a decadent Italian dessert that layers coffee-soaked ladyfingers with a rich mascarpone cream. Finished off with a dusting of cocoa powder, this dessert is a perfect balance of flavors—sweet, creamy, and slightly bitter from the coffee.

Ingredients:
6 large egg yolks
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 1/2 cups mascarpone cheese, softened
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups brewed espresso or strong coffee, cooled
1/4 cup coffee liqueur (optional, e.g., Kahlúa)
2 packs of ladyfingers (about 24-30 pieces)
Unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting
Dark chocolate shavings (optional, for garnish)
Prep Time: 30 minutes
Cook Time: None (chill time: 4 hours or overnight)
Servings: 8-10 servings
Instructions:
Prepare the Mascarpone Cream:

In a large mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar together until pale and smooth.
Add the mascarpone cheese and vanilla extract to the mixture, whisking until smooth and fully combined.
Whip the Cream:

In a separate bowl, beat the heavy cream with an electric mixer on high speed until stiff peaks form. This may take 3-4 minutes.
Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture using a spatula. Be careful not to deflate the whipped cream; fold until just combined.
Prepare the Coffee Soak:

In a shallow dish, combine the brewed espresso (or strong coffee) and coffee liqueur (if using). Stir to combine. Let the coffee cool to room temperature.
Assemble the Tiramisu:

Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture for 1-2 seconds. Do not soak them; they should be moist but not soggy.
Arrange a layer of dipped ladyfingers at the bottom of a 9x13-inch dish (or use individual cups for serving).
Spread half of the mascarpone cream mixture evenly over the ladyfingers.
Repeat Layers:

Add another layer of dipped ladyfingers on top of the cream layer. Follow with the remaining mascarpone cream and smooth it out evenly.
Chill:

Cover the tiramisu with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight. This allows the flavors to meld and the dessert to set properly.
Serve and Garnish:

Before serving, dust the top with unsweetened cocoa powder using a fine-mesh sieve. Garnish with dark chocolate shavings or cocoa nibs if desired.
