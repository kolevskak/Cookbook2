Ingredients:
200g (7 oz) dark chocolate (70% cocoa recommended)
3 large eggs, separated
1/4 cup g

Ingredients:
6 large egg yolks
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 1/2 cups mascarpone cheese, softened
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups brewed espresso or strong coffee, cooled
1/4 cup coffee liqueur (optional, e.g., Kahlúa)
2 packs of ladyfingers (about 24-30 pieces)
Unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting
Dark chocolate shavings (optional, for garnish)
Instructions:
Make the Cream Mixture: In a large mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar together until the mixture is pale and smooth. Add the mascarpone cheese and vanilla extract, and continue to whisk until well combined and creamy.

Whip the Cream: In a separate bowl, beat the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture until smooth and well combined.

Prepare the Coffee Soak: In a shallow dish, combine the brewed espresso (or coffee) with the coffee liqueur (if using). Stir to combine.

Assemble the Tiramisu: Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture for about 1-2 seconds, making sure not to soak them too long. Arrange a layer of the soaked ladyfingers at the bottom of a 9x13-inch dish (or individual serving cups if preferred).

Layer the Cream: Spread half of the mascarpone cream mixture over the ladyfingers. Smooth it out into an even layer.

Repeat the Layers: Add another layer of dipped ladyfingers on top of the cream, followed by the remaining mascarpone mixture. Spread the cream evenly over the top.

Chill and Set: Cover the tiramisu with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. This allows the flavors to meld and the dessert to set.

Garnish and Serve: Before serving, dust the top with a generous layer of unsweetened cocoa powder. For extra flair, garnish with dark chocolate shavings or cocoa nibs.
