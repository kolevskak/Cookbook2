Chocolate Mousse
Chocolate mousse is the ultimate indulgence—a velvety, airy dessert that combines the richness of chocolate with a light, fluffy texture. Perfect for special occasions or a sweet treat after a meal, this mousse is surprisingly easy to make and always a hit.

Ingredients:
200g (7 oz) dark chocolate (70% cocoa recommended)
3 large eggs, separated
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup heavy cream
A pinch of salt
Whipped cream (optional, for topping)
Chocolate shavings or cocoa powder (optional, for garnish)
Instructions:
Melt the Chocolate: Break the dark chocolate into small pieces and melt it either in a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method) or in the microwave in 30-second intervals. Stir until smooth and fully melted. Let it cool slightly.

Whip the Egg Whites: In a clean bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt using an electric mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add the granulated sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form. Set aside.

Whisk the Egg Yolks: In another bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the vanilla extract until smooth and slightly pale in color.

Combine the Chocolate and Egg Yolks: Slowly add the melted chocolate into the egg yolk mixture, stirring gently to combine.

Fold in the Whipped Cream: In a separate bowl, beat the heavy cream until it forms soft peaks. Carefully fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture until smooth and well incorporated.

Fold in the Egg Whites: Gently fold the whipped egg whites into the chocolate mixture in three batches. Be careful not to deflate the mousse—use a light hand to maintain its airy texture.

Chill and Serve: Spoon the mousse into serving glasses or bowls and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until set. Before serving, top with whipped cream and garnish with chocolate shavings or a dusting of cocoa powder, if desired.
