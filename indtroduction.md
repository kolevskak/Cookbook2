Instructions:
Step 1: Brew the Coffee
Brew 2 cups of strong coffee or espresso.
If you have an espresso machine, aim for a dark, rich shot of espresso.
If you're using regular coffee, make it strong—about twice as strong as you usually brew.
Let the coffee cool to room temperature.
Once cool, mix in 2 tablespoons of coffee liqueur (optional) and 1 tablespoon of sugar (optional, depending on sweetness preference).
Step 2: Make the Mascarpone Cream
Prepare the egg mixture:

In a large heatproof bowl, whisk 4 egg yolks and 1 cup of granulated sugar together.
Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method) and whisk constantly until the mixture becomes pale and slightly thickened. This should take about 5 minutes.
Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
Add the mascarpone cheese:

Beat the mascarpone cheese in a separate bowl until smooth and creamy.
Gradually fold the mascarpone into the egg mixture. Use a spatula to gently incorporate them until well combined.
Whip the cream:

In a chilled mixing bowl, whip 1 cup of heavy cream with ¼ cup powdered sugar until stiff peaks form.
Fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture:

Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture. Be careful not to deflate the whipped cream too much. You want the mixture to stay light and airy.
Step 3: Assemble the Tiramisu
Dip the ladyfingers:

Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the cooled coffee mixture. Be careful not to soak them too long—just a quick dip (about 1-2 seconds) will do. The ladyfingers should be moist but not soggy.
Layer the dessert:

In a 9x9-inch or similar-sized dish, arrange a layer of dipped ladyfingers at the bottom. This will be your base layer.
Spread half of the mascarpone cream mixture over the ladyfingers. Use a spatula to smooth it out evenly.
Repeat the layers:

Add another layer of dipped ladyfingers on top of the mascarpone mixture.
Spread the remaining mascarpone cream over the second layer of ladyfingers.
Step 4: Chill and Set
Cover the tiramisu with plastic wrap or foil.
Refrigerate the tiramisu for at least 4 hours, but ideally overnight. This allows the flavors to meld and the dessert to firm up.
Step 5: Serve
Just before serving, dust the top generously with unsweetened cocoa powder. You can also add some dark chocolate shavings if desired for extra flavor and texture.
Slice and serve chilled.
