⏲ Total Time: 20 minutes (Prep: 10 min | Cook: 10 min)

Ingredients:
6 large eggs
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon white vinegar
Salt and pepper, to taste
Paprika, for garnish
Fresh parsley (optional), for garnish
Instructions:
1️⃣ Boil the Eggs
Place the eggs in a saucepan and cover them with cold water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to low and let simmer for 9-10 minutes. Remove and transfer eggs to an ice bath to cool for 5-10 minutes.

2️⃣ Peel and Halve the Eggs
Once cool, gently crack the shells and peel the eggs. Slice in half lengthwise and remove the yolks.

3️⃣ Make the Filling
Mash the yolks in a bowl until smooth. Add mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, white vinegar, salt, and pepper. Mix until creamy and well combined. Adjust seasoning to taste.

4️⃣ Fill the Eggs
Spoon or pipe the yolk mixture back into the egg whites, filling each half generously.

5️⃣ Garnish and Serve
Sprinkle with paprika for a pop of color and flavor. Optionally, garnish with fresh parsley. Serve chilled.
