Deviled Eggs
Deviled eggs are a classic appetizer thatâ€™s both easy to make and always a crowd-pleaser. With a creamy, flavorful filling inside a perfectly cooked egg, these bite-sized treats are perfect for parties, picnics, or family gatherings.

Ingredients:
6 large eggs
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon white vinegar
Salt and pepper, to taste
Paprika, for garnish
Fresh parsley (optional), for garnish
Instructions:
Boil the Eggs: Place the eggs in a saucepan and cover them with cold water. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and let the eggs simmer for about 9-10 minutes. Remove from heat and place the eggs in an ice bath to cool for 5-10 minutes.

Peel and Halve the Eggs: Once the eggs are cool enough to handle, gently crack the shells and peel the eggs. Slice them in half lengthwise and remove the yolks.

Make the Filling: Mash the yolks in a bowl until smooth. Add the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, white vinegar, salt, and pepper. Mix until the filling is creamy and well combined. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.

Fill the Eggs: Spoon or pipe the yolk mixture back into the egg whites, filling each half generously.

Garnish and Serve: Sprinkle with paprika for a pop of color and flavor. Optionally, garnish with fresh parsley for a fresh touch. Serve chilled.
